					<h2>My life</h2>
					<p>
						My name is Austin Miller and I am currently a junior at SMU pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am originally from San Antonio, Texas and am a diehard Spurs fan. I have been interested in Computer 
						Science since my sophmore year of highschool and am now way too invested to switch majors (kidding). When I'm not coding I enjoy playing hard video games, listening to Kanye West, and going out with my friends. Outside of the house I like to run and play basketball to stay in shape. I've also spent the past few summers working as a camp counselor which explains why I feel the need to make dad-jokes constantly. One day I hope to own a miniture dachshund and name him Rolf. The fact that I will need money to take care of Rolf is how I find strength to go to school everyday. But enough about my personality, here's what classes I've taken.
